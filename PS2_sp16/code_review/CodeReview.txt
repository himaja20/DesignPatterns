1. Java Docs did not include description about return Values
2. Java Docs did not include description about what the function performs
3. Cases for Null Pointer Exception are not handled with care
Ex:  person.getPersonAddress() != null && person.getPersonAddress().equals(property) might throw a NPE on the second expression
	 deletion of a contact if a null object is a passed as a parameter is not handled
4. Extensive use of Standard out. There is no need for functions like "printContacts()" which print contacts to stdout. That is not the requirement of an API
5. No equals and hashcode implementations in Address book class.
6. Code could have been indented properly.

8. Exceptions are printed to stacktrace, which are not expected to be seen by the end user.
9. No validations for Phone and email. For example: A Phone number should only contain numbers.
